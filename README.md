# youtube-replica
For The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/embedding-images-and-video)
This is my own replication of what a webpage of a youtube video would look like. 
Using this I learned to embed videos and images to websites. Also I improved on positioning objects, learning to apply grids to allow for a more structred design and easy scalability.
